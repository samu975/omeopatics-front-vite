# JavaScript Development Rules

This rule applies to: *.js, *.jsx, *.ts, *.tsx

## Overview
Guidelines for writing clean, modern JavaScript code.

## JavaScript Best Practices
- Use modern ES6+ syntax (const/let, arrow functions, template literals)
- Implement proper event handling with event delegation where appropriate
- Ensure scripts are non-blocking (defer attribute or placed before closing body tag)
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Implement proper error handling
- Keep JavaScript unobtrusive - separate behavior from content and presentation
- Use vanilla JavaScript when possible, avoiding unnecessary dependencies

## Code Organization
- Group related functionality into modules
- Use clear, descriptive function and variable names
- Comment complex logic or non-obvious code
- Implement proper error handling with try/catch where appropriate

## DOM Interaction
- Use event delegation for multiple similar elements
- Cache DOM selections when used multiple times
- Avoid direct manipulation of style properties, prefer class toggling
- Use dataset attributes for storing data on elements

## Performance
- Debounce or throttle event handlers for scroll, resize, etc.
- Avoid memory leaks by properly removing event listeners
- Minimize DOM reflows and repaints
- Use requestAnimationFrame for animations
